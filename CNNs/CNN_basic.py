# Tensors are N-Dimensional Arrays (Scalar, Vector, Matrix, Tensor)
# Tensors make it convenient to feed in sets of images into the model (Images, Height, Width, Color)

# Convolutions have a major advantage for Image Processing, as the pixels next to each other are more correlated for image detection
# Each CNN layer looks at an increasingly larger part of the image

# Padding is essential for edge cases, where the convolution operation may not be possible due to lack of pixels

# 1D vs 2D Convolution
# Stride - Number of units at a time

# Pooling Layers subsample the image, reducing memory use and computer load

# Dropout can be thought of as a form of regularization to prevent overfitting
